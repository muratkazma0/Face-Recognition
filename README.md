# Face Recognition
 This Python code detects faces in a video using OpenCV. It loads a pre-trained face detection classifier, reads each frame, converts it to grayscale, and identifies faces using the Haar cascade classifier. Detected faces are outlined in blue rectangles. The program exits on 'q' press.
